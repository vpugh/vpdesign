            <p>This studio is run by <a class="text-link" href="http://toripugh.com" target="_blank">Victoria "Tori" Pugh</a>, a designer, developer, and strategist based in Philadelphia, PA. She has years experience in different aspects of the digital spectrum. She uses all this knowledge to craft complete digital solutions from top to bottom. She started her career in print, doing marketing and advertisements. Then she progressed into digital with designing and developing emails. Now, she does UX/UI and strategy along with front-end development.</p>
            <p>She loves to hear your problems and work through them with you to create solutions. Some can be easy, others it can take longer. Finding a solution is one of her strong points. From design and development of emails; user research and strategy; design and development of websites; and project inception to completion. She can do it all while keeping in mind the small details that make a big difference. She understands the careful intricacy that is present with the whole system.</p>
            <p>She's worked in fields, the medical and pharma, that are highly regulated and require a great attention to detail. She can balance tight requirements and finding a fun and good looking solution.</p>
            <p>There's a term for people who really love emails, working with, designing, or developing. She is a #emailgeek. The desire to the craft creates great emails that work where your subscribers and customers are. Factors much more than how an email looks, there are more metrics than that.</p>
