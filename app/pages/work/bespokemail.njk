            <h2 class="heading">The Brief</h2>
            <p>After creating a code-based solution to managing different templates of email and incorporating large amounts of data into them I realized this isn't the most user-friendly. I decided to make a system to be used by non-coders that had the same level of use. It would rely on a base of code and then is would self reliant on the data and the person entering that in.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">The Approach</h2>
            <p>My first idea was to create a computer-based app. This would be powered by <a class="text-link" href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">Electron</a> a software that powers many popular app, one being Spotify. I enjoy using <a class="text-link" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> and thought the layout they used might be conducive to the project. The setup with the dashboard on the left and the editor/main content on the right seemed ideal for visual editing. These are the steps I took in the first iteration.</p>

            <p>A good start but I was having trouble developing with Electron and didn't like the look of the layout. I'm not sure I was ever a 100% sold on the tabbing system and having all the settings in little drop-down menus all over the window. I tried to emulate VS Code too much. I didn't account for my content in the window. It started getting cluttered and jumbled.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">Iteration #2</h2>
            <p>After abandoning my Spotify inspired version, I searched for a better layout. Reverting to something cleaner and more user-friendly I settled on a left side full of inputs and drop-down menus. With the right side where all the visual elements would happen. The visual side is big enough to accomodate the "suggested size" of email (600px wide).</p>
            <p>Right now its more a visual setup preparing for the behind the scenes functionality. I was more concerned with creating a smooth experience for editing and managing emails. I grouped content together and even now think I could combine some forms together and separate them from other sections to streamline the forms.</p>
